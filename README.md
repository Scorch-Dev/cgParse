## Status

Active development on this project is not going on as of right now, but I'll do what I can to pfix bugs as they're found.

## Motivation

cgParse is a chaotic-good parser in C# for command line arguments. It borrows its concepts and style from the Python ArgParse library to make it more convenient to parse cli arguments simply in C#.

It was originally part of the SentineL project by Foxlore Studios, and it served as the argument parser for the in-game developer console. Eventually I decided to spin it off into its own repository.

## Usage Notes

You can find usage details on the GitHub wiki.

## Bugfixes and Suggestions
If you find any bugs, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I don't actively monitor this project too closely, so I can't guarentee any time frames, but I'll do my best to addres them in a timely fashion.
